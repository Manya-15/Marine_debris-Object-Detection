      <p>The objective of the AI-WasteGuard project is to utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to address the pervasive problem of waste pollution in water bodies. By employing advanced image classification techniques, the project aims to autonomously detect and classify various types of waste materials present in rivers, lakes, and oceans. This proactive approach will provide environmental authorities with real-time insights into water quality, enabling swift and targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of pollution on aquatic ecosystems and human health.</p>
